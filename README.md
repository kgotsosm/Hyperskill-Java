# Coffee Machine

**This project is a simulation of a coffee machine, developed as part of the Java Developer track on hyperskill. The objective of the project is to create a program that can perform multiple actions based on user input.**

## Functionality:

- Buy a cup of coffee (espresso, latte or cappuccino) by entering "buy"
- Fill the coffee machine's resources (water, milk, coffee beans) by entering "fill"
- Take money from the coffee machine by entering "take"
- View the remaining resources in the coffee machine by entering "remaining"
- Exit the program by entering "exit"

**The program uses object-oriented programming concepts and has been designed to be modular and easily extensible. Each action (buy, fill, take, remaining) has been implemented as a separate method to improve the code's readability and maintainability.**

To run the program, simply clone the repository and execute the CoffeeMachine.java file. The program will prompt the user for input and provide the necessary feedback based on the action taken.
