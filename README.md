COFFEE MACHINE

This is the Coffee Machine project for the Java Developer track on hyperskill.
 
"Let's improve the program so it can do multiple actions, one after another. The program should repeatedly ask what the user wants to do. If the user types "buy", "fill" or "take", then just do what the program did in the previous step. However, if the user wants to switch off the coffee machine, he should type "exit". Then the program should terminate. Also, when the user types "remaining", the program should output all the resources that the coffee machine has.

Also, do not forget that you can be out of resources for making coffee. If the coffee machine doesn’t have enough resources to make coffee, the program should output a message that says it can't make a cup of coffee.

And the last improvement to the program at this step—if the user types "buy" to buy a cup of coffee and then changes his mind, he should be able to type "back" to return into the main cycle."

The way I solved this problem was by creating methods for all the different options that are available to the user. 
All the code was to loop until the user input was "exit", then the program would stop.
